This is a classical dynamical system often used to model the flow induced oscillation of flexible structures such as turbine blades. It is relevant as a preliminary fluid-structure interaction model, successfully demonstrating the oscillation modes in blade rotor structures in attached flow conditions. The potential flow model used here is also significant because the modern turbine rotors are, in general, regulated in stall and pitch in order to avoid dynamic stall induced vibrations.","tags":[],"title":"Uncertainty Quantification of a Nonlinear Aeroelastic System Using PCE With Constant Phase Interpolation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ajit Desai","Sunetra Sarkar"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1579543101,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579543101,"objectID":"5d7ace043a58a930e7efc6a564213923","permalink":"/publication/my-pub1/","publishdate":"2010-07-18T12:58:21-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/my-pub1/","section":"publication","summary":"Uncertainties can play a significant role in the aeroelastic stability predictions in a nonlinear system. The analysis has been put in a stochastic framework, and the propagation of system uncertainties has been quantified in the aeroelastic response. A spectral uncertainty quantification tool called Polynomial Chaos Expansion has been used. A projection-based nonintrusive Polynomial Chaos approach is shown to be much faster than its classical Galerkin method based counterpart.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of a Nonlinear Aeroelastic System with Parametric Uncertainties Using Polynomial Chaos Expansion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ajit Desai","Han Du","Rodney Garratt","Francisco Rivadeneyra","Pablo Samuel Castro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575057543,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575057543,"objectID":"960aedf95e63f04f8515a02fdb84ec08","permalink":"/talk/my-talk1/","publishdate":"2019-11-29T14:59:03-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/my-talk1/","section":"talk","summary":"This paper utilizes deep reinforcement learning to approximate the policy rules of banks participating in a high-value payments system.
