The analysis has been put in a stochastic framework, and the propagation of system uncertainties has been quantified in the aeroelastic response. A spectral uncertainty quantification tool called Polynomial Chaos Expansion has been used. A projection-based nonintrusive Polynomial Chaos approach is shown to be much faster than its classical Galerkin method based counterpart.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of a Nonlinear Aeroelastic System with Parametric Uncertainties Using Polynomial Chaos Expansion","type":"publication"}]
